# GUI calculator using the tkinter library.
This Python code creates a simple calculator GUI using the tkinter library. The calculator window features a clean and intuitive design with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and functions. Here's a brief description of the code:

•The code initializes a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter and sets up the main window of the calculator.
•The calculator is titled "Simple Calculator" and has dimensions of 440x520 pixels. It cannot be resized.
•The GUI components are styled with specific fonts, colors, and positioning on the window.
•The calculator's main display is implemented using a label named label_result, which shows the current equation entered by the user.•
•Numeric digit buttons (0-9) are present along with buttons for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
•A "C" button clears the current equation, and a "." button adds decimal points to the numbers.
•The code includes functions like show() to update the equation with the pressed button's value and clear() to reset the equation.
•The calculate() function processes the equation and displays the result on the calculator's display label. Any errors are handled gracefully, showing "Error" on the display.
•The calculator GUI provides a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic calculations.
•The code is suitable for educational purposes and can be a starting point for beginners to learn about GUI programming in Python using the tkinter library.
